# VulRepair Replication Study

This repository contains the **reproduction report** for *VulRepair: A T5-Based Automated Software Vulnerability Repair*. Our study investigates the reproducibility of VulRepair and analyzes how pre-training, tokenization, and dataset quality affect its performance.

## 📘 Overview

We re-implemented and evaluated all 10 variants of the VulRepair model on both the original and **deduplicated** versions of the CVEFixes dataset. Our evaluation focuses on four key research questions related to model accuracy, pre-training, tokenization, and component contributions.

## 🧪 Research Questions

1. **RQ1:** What is the accuracy of VulRepair for generating vulnerability repairs?
2. **RQ2:** What is the benefit of using pre-training?
3. **RQ3:** What is the impact of BPE tokenization?
4. **RQ4:** How do individual components (architecture, tokenizer, pre-training) contribute?
